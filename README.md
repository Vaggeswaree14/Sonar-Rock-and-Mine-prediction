Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning in Python
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that can predict whether an object detected by sonar waves is a rock or a mine. Submarines often rely on sonar signals for underwater navigation and object detection, making such predictive models critical for automation and safety.

Project Overview
Using a labeled dataset of sonar signal returns, we train a supervised learning model to distinguish between rocks and mines based on the characteristics of the reflected sonar waves. This project uses Python and applies Logistic Regression, a simple yet effective classification algorithm, to solve the binary classification problem.

Key Features
Supervised learning approach for binary classification (Rock vs Mine).

Dataset consists of sonar signal returns for training and evaluation.

Model training, evaluation, and prediction implemented in Python.

Logistic Regression model used for building the predictive system.

Objective
To develop an ML-based solution that can reliably predict the type of object (rock or mine) using sonar data, contributing toward real-world applications in marine exploration and defense.
